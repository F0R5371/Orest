# OREST

## Intro

Welcome to the official repository for Orest, a note-taking/language learning companion designed to help 
you through your journey of learning Chinese.

Orest offers a fully functional and accurate English-Chinese dictionary, as well as a note taking section 
that allows users to record new words or
phrases they encounter when learning Chinese.

## Note Taking

Orest allows users to note take with a variety of different writing tools alongside them. This makes for 
quick and easy note-taking whilst reading through Chinese 
text you may be studying.
5 basic tools are offered for note-taking as of currently:
- Bolding
- Italicizing
- Underlining
- Strikethrough
- 10 Colors of highlighter

*Note that writing tool changes do not export to .txt files.*

## Dictionary

As well as notes, for the words you jot down a dictionary is provided to look up those unknown words. Basic
implementation of pinyin look up (using the numbering system of tones or no tones), English to Chinese, and Chinese
to English look up are all supported.
